## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

### Current Issues

1. **Missing Favicon**: The app is missing a proper favicon file. To fix this issue:
   - Add a proper favicon.ico file to the public folder
   - OR edit `app/layout.tsx` to use a different icon with `<link rel="icon" href="/logo.png" />`

2. **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter errors about missing modules like 'critters':
   - Install the missing module: `npm install critters`
   - OR disable the feature in `next.config.js` by setting `optimizeCss: false`

3. **Running on Windows PowerShell**: If you're having trouble with running commands in PowerShell:
   - Run these commands separately instead of using the '&&' operator:
     ```
     cd eaglesounds
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Or use Command Prompt (cmd) instead of PowerShell

4. **Missing Static Images**: If you see placeholders instead of actual images:
   - Add appropriate images to the public folder following the naming conventions
   - For testing, you can use placeholder services like https://placehold.co/

### Quick Fix to Run the App

To quickly get the app running without errors:

1. Navigate to the eaglesounds directory
2. Create or download a favicon.ico file and place it in the public folder
3. Run `npm install critters` to add the missing dependency
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

If you still encounter issues, try the following steps:

1. Delete the .next folder to clear the build cache
2. Run `npm install` to make sure all dependencies are properly installed
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
