# Placeholder Images

This directory contains placeholder images that are used as fallbacks in case the actual images fail to load. In many cases, CSS-based placeholders are used from the `globals.css` file with the following classes:

- `placeholder-bg` - Light blue gradient background
- `placeholder-bg-dark` - Dark blue gradient background
- `placeholder-bg-stripe` - Striped light blue pattern
- `hero-placeholder` - Special gradient for hero sections

These CSS-based placeholders can be used alongside the components, particularly with the `PlaceholderImage` component that automatically falls back to a placeholder if an image fails to load.
